# HarborHarmony - Berth Allocation Problem Optimization 

## Overview
HarborHarmony is a project aimed at solving the NP-hard Berth Allocation Problem using four types of algorithms - "Base Cuckoo Search", "Clustering Based Cuckoo Search", "Enhanced Cuckoo Search", and "Enhanced Clustering Cuckoo Search". These algorithms are designed to efficiently allocate berths in a harbor to incoming ships while optimizing various constraints and objectives.

## Algorithms
1. **Base Cuckoo Search**: This algorithm is a basic implementation of the Cuckoo Search optimization method. It simulates the brood parasitism of some cuckoo species.
   
2. **Clustering Based Cuckoo Search**: This algorithm extends the Base Cuckoo Search by incorporating clustering techniques to enhance the search process and improve convergence speed.
   
3. **Enhanced Cuckoo Search**: Building upon the Base Cuckoo Search, this algorithm includes additional enhancements to further improve the search capability and solution quality.
   
4. **Enhanced Clustering Cuckoo Search**: An advanced version of the Clustering Based Cuckoo Search, this algorithm combines clustering methods with additional enhancements to achieve superior berth allocation solutions.

## Getting Started
To use HarborHarmony for solving the Berth Allocation Problem with the aforementioned algorithms, follow these steps:
1. Clone the HarborHarmony repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as listed in the project's requirements.txt file.
3. Choose the algorithm you want to use for berth allocation.
4. Run the main script with the selected algorithm to generate optimized berth allocations for ships.

## Usage
```python
python main.py --algorithm "Base Cuckoo Search"
```
