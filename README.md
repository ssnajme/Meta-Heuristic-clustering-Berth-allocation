# Berth Allocation and Vessel Scheduling in Multi-Berth Container Terminals Using an Enhanced Cuckoo Search Algorithm with Gaussian Mixture Clustering

## Overview

The Berth Allocation problem is an NP-hard problem characterized by a high-dimensional objective function. This project focuses on solving the multi-objective optimization challenges involved in berth allocation using an enhanced Cuckoo Search Algorithm, which is gradient-free.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following optimization algorithms are implemented in this project:

- **Enhanced Cuckoo Search Algorithm:** A novel method to improve the performance of the standard Cuckoo Search in solving the Berth Allocation problem.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO):** A well-known optimization technique inspired by social behaviors of birds.
- **Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA):** A probabilistic model-based optimization algorithm.
- **Base Cuckoo Search Algorithm:** The traditional version of the Cuckoo Search algorithm for benchmarking purposes.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/berth-allocation.git
cd berth-allocation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the enhanced Cuckoo Search Algorithm and benchmark it against other algorithms, execute the following command:

```bash
python EachAlgorithm.py
```

This command will run the optimization process and output the results, including comparisons between different algorithms.

## Results

Results from the optimization can be found in the `results/` directory, including performance metrics for each algorithm. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhanced Cuckoo Search Algorithm compared to PSO, EDA, and the base Cuckoo Search.
